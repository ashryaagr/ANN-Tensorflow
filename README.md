Deep-Learning with Tensorflow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository is just a collection of python scripts which I wrote while learning to use Tensorflow. 
<br>
Description of some of the scripts :
1. <b>linearreg.py</b> : Implemented linear regression with Tensorflow .<br>
2. <b>logisticreg.py</b> : Implemented logistic regression with Tensorflow .<br>
3.  <b>digit_recog1.py</b> :  A simple Multi-Layer perceptron without any hidden layer for digit recognition. The accuracy was about 91% .<br>
4.  <b>digit_recog2.py</b> :  A simple Deep neural network (Convolution Neural Network) with dropout and multiple hidden layers. The accuracy was about 96% .<br>
